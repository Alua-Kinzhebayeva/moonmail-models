# MoonMail Models

### Getting Started
We are assuming that you'll run this code inside an AWS Lambda function, with a role that has enough permissions to read/write DynamoDB.

Install the package:

    npm install https://github.com/microapps/moonmail-models

Set the required environment variables with the corresponding DynamoDB table names:

    LINKS_TABLE
    CAMPAIGNS_TABLE
